# #oshcamp2023 Badge Rust Materials

A little collection of personal materials for using the [Open Source Hardware Camp 2023](https://oshug.org/event/oshcamp2023) badge with rust.
You can find the design files for the badge in the `badge-design` directory, or [here](https://github.com/electrolama/oshcamp23-badge/tree/main).

Everything in this repo requires [the `rust-esp` toolchain](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust-build).

I only have the "easy mode" badge layout available to me, so **all tools in here use this layout**.
